# Problem:
# You are given a string num which represents a positive integer, and an integer t.
# A number is called zero-free if none of its digits are 0.
# Return a string representing the smallest zero-free number greater than or equal to num such that the product of its digits is divisible by t. If no such number exists, return "-1".
# Example 1:
# Input: num = "1234", t = 256
# Output: "1488"
# Explanation:
# The smallest zero-free number that is greater than 1234 and has the product of its digits divisible by 256 is 1488, with the product of its digits equal to 256.
# Example 2:
# Input: num = "12355", t = 50
# Output: "12355"
# Explanation:
# 12355 is already zero-free and has the product of its digits divisible by 50, with the product of its digits equal to 150.
# Example 3:
# Input: num = "11111", t = 26
# Output: "-1"
# Explanation:
# No number greater than 11111 has the product of its digits divisible by 26.
# Constraints:
# 2 <= num.length <= 2 * 105
# num consists only of digits in the range ['0', '9'].
# num does not contain leading zeros.
# 1 <= t <= 10^14
# Hint:
# To optimize the solution using the factors of t, we can:                                                                   
#  1 Generate all prime factors of t. 
#  2 If any prime factor of t is greather than 9, return "-1"                                                                                      
#  3 Otherwise use these prime factors and "1" as digits to construct the smallest number greater than or equal to num that is divisible by t.
