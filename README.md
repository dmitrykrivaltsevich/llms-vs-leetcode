# LLMs vs. LeetCode

This repository is a collection of Python solutions to LeetCode problems, all generated with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents such as Aider, Claude, and Gemini. The primary goal of this project is to explore the capabilities and limitations of AI in the context of algorithmic problem-solving.

## About This Project

The solutions in this repository are not just about finding the most optimal answer but also about the process of collaborating with AI to generate, refine, and test code. Many of the solution files are accompanied by a corresponding test file to ensure correctness.

## Current LeetCode Problems

Here is a list of the LeetCode problems that have been solved so far:

-   [1. Two Sum](_0001_two_sum.py)
-   [2. Add Two Numbers](_0002_add_two_numbers.py)
-   [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](_0003_longest_substring_without_repeating_chars.py)
-   [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](_0004_median_two_sorted_arrays.py)
-   [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](_0005_longest_palindromic_substring.py)
-   [6. Zigzag Conversion](_0006_zigzag_conversion.py)
-   [10. Regular Expression Matching](_0010_regular_expression_matching.py)
-   [480. Sliding Window Median](_0480_sliding_window_median.py)
-   [746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](_0746_min_cost_climbing_stairs.py)
-   [2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies](_2115_find_all_possible_recipes_from_given_supplies.py)
-   [2685. Count the Number of Complete Components](_2685_count_the_number_of_complete_components.py)
-   [3348. Smallest Divisible Digit Product 2](_3348_smallest_divisible_digit_product_2.py)

## How to Use

To run any of the solutions, you can execute the corresponding test file. For example, to test the "Two Sum" solution, run the following command:

```bash
python _test_0001_two_sum.py
```
